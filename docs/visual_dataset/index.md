# Visual Dataset

The "Fetal MRI Browser," or more generally known as a "ChRIS Visual Dataset Browser,"
is a feature of [ChRIS_ui](https://github.com/FNNDSC/ChRIS_ui) which uses
[NiiVue](https://github.com/niivue/niivue) to visualize neuroimaging data found in public feeds.

To see a dataset in the Visual Dataset Browser, it is necessary to run the plugin
[pl-visual-dataset](https://github.com/FNNDSC/pl-visual-dataset).
The parameters for pl-visual-dataset are also used to add metadata to a dataset
such as author, academic references, and default Niivue options for each file.
