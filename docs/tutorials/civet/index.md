# Running CIVET on _ChRIS_ at FNNDSC

_CIVET_ is a T1 MRI processing pipeline (similar to FreeSurfer) developed at the Montr√©al Neurological Institute (MNI). This tutorial is a beginner-level walk-through of how to run _CIVET_ on _ChRIS_ at the FNNDSC.

### 1. Log in to _ChRIS_

Go to **http://chris-next.tch.harvard.edu:2222/login** and log in using your FNNDSC account username and password.

### 2. Create a feed

Data are imported into _ChRIS_ in _feeds._

1. Click **"Create Feed"** in the top-right corner. 
2. Choose the **"Generate Data"** option.
3. Select the `pl-neurofiles-pull` plugin, which pulls data from `/neuro/labs/grantlab/research` into _ChRIS_.
4. Specify which path to pull as the `--path` parameter.
5. Keep clicking "Next" until the feed is created.

The path you choose _must_ be a directory containing exactly one _NIFTI_ file called `*_T1w.nii`.
Any unrelated files (such as `*.json`, `*._T2w.nii`) will also be uploaded to _ChRIS_ but ignored by the pipeline.

### 3. Run the pipeline

Click into the feed you just created, and right-click the only circle in the top-left quadrant. Select **"Add a pipeline."**

Search for the "CIVET" pipeline and select it.

Carefully review the pipeline's options before you run it. Make sure that each step of the pipeline is configured to run on **"galena,"** our private compute cluster. You may also choose "NERC," a public cloud, as long as your data does not contain PHI.

Once the pipeline is running, you can see each of its steps and their statuses. You can see that the pipeline selects the `*_T1w.nii` file, renames it to `*_t1.nii`, then converts it to MINC.

### 4. Wait a couple hours

CIVET takes 4-8 hours to run to completion.

## Next Steps

You now know how to run _CIVET_ using the _ChRIS_ user interface.
Next steps might include visualization and downstream analyses of _CIVET_
outputs, or scaling up to run this pipeline on multiple subjects.
