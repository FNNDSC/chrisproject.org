# Website Hosting

Our domain names chrisproject.org, fnndsc.org, babymri.org, ... are purchased on GoDaddy.
They can be managed by logging into https://www.godaddy.com/.
Hint: we have two GoDaddy accounts.

## Static Websites

Use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I recommend using the [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) framework.

## Hosting Web Apps

The best place to host web apps is on the NERC OpenShift.
To use HTTPS with custom domains on OpenShift, follow [this guide](nerc/https/index.md).
