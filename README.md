## Contributing

The source code of this repository is built automatically by
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/FNNDSC/chrisproject.org/actions)
and deployed to GitHub Pages.

Most pages are just Markdown files, so it should be easy enough to contribute.

### Editing Pages on GitHub.com

Markdown pages can be edited by clicking "Edit this page" on the page
itself, then "Edit this file" on GitHub.com.

When creating a new page on GitHub.com, be sure to follow the
[naming conventions](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog#blog-post-date).

### Local Development

Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation), then run

```shell
# install dependencies
pnpm i

# start development server
pnpm start
```

You can run these checks manually, and fix some of the errors:


```shell
# show lint and formatting issues
pnpm run fix

# automatically format the code
pnpm run fmt

# automatically fix some issues
pnpm run fix

# automatically fix more issues, but with Â¡danger!
pnpm run fix:unsafe
```
