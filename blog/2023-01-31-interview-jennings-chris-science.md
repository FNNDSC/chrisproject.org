Raghuram Banda and [Ishu Verma](https://www.redhat.com/en/authors/ishu-verma) of Red Hat
interview Jennings about how he is using _ChRIS_ to power quantitative neuroanatomy research
at the FNNDSC of the Boston Children's Hospital.

During the interview, Jennings explains his research on using polygonal mesh surface
models to measure the thickness of a developmental brain layer known as the "subplate
zone" from human *in-utero* fetal magnetic resonance (MR) images. Tuning the mesh
algorithm requires a large amount of computational power and a system for tracking
the data provenance of his experiments. _ChRIS_ provides scientists like Jennings a
platform for running computational experiments reproducibly.
